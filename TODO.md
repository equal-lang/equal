## Timeline in November
1. Finish development of an online interpreter, adding a new field, finishing new file and save as
2. Tighten up / rewrite lexer
3. Clean up parser, redirecting calls at the earliest possible time
4. Clean up error handling, with sychronized errors and line numbers
4. Try to go through some of [this course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-035-computer-language-engineering-spring-2010/) if have time
